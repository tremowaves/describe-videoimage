**TL;DR**: Our Describe Anything Model (DAM) takes in a region of an image or a video in the form of points/boxes/scribbles/masks and outputs detailed descriptions to the region. For videos, it is sufficient to supply an annotation on any frame. We also release a new benchmark, DLC-Bench, to evaluate models on the DLC task.

# Running Describe Anything Model

## Installation

Install the `dam` package:

```sh
# You can install it without cloning the repo
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/describe-anything

# You can also clone the repo and install it locally
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/describe-anything
cd describe-anything
pip install -v .
```

We also provide a self-contained script for detailed localized image descriptions without installing additional dependencies. Please refer to the [examples/dam_with_sam_self_contained.py](examples/dam_with_sam_self_contained.py) or [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bQqAMRH2vdjoWpDpuMSb3SBf_OAntadZ?usp=sharing) for more details.

## Interactive Demo

```sh
# You can use it with points or a bounding box for the region of interest.
# SAM is used to turn points or a bounding box into a mask.
# You can also use mask directly, see `examples/query_dam_server.py`.
python examples/dam_with_sam.py --image_path images/1.jpg --points '[[1172, 812], [1572, 800]]' --output_image_path output_visualization.png
python examples/dam_with_sam.py --image_path images/1.jpg --box '[800, 500, 1800, 1000]' --use_box --output_image_path output_visualization.png
```

```sh
# You can use it with points or a bounding box for the region of interest. Annotation on one frame is sufficient.
# You can also use mask directly, see `examples/query_dam_server_video.py`.
python examples/dam_video_with_sam2.py --video_dir videos/1 --points '[[1824, 397]]' --output_image_dir videos/1_visualization
python examples/dam_video_with_sam2.py --video_dir videos/1 --box '[1612, 364, 1920, 430]' --use_box --output_image_dir videos/1_visualization

# You can also use video file directly.
python examples/dam_video_with_sam2.py --video_file videos/1.mp4 --points '[[1824, 397]]' --output_image_dir videos/1_visualization

A sleek, silver SUV is prominently featured, showcasing a modern and aerodynamic design. The vehicle's smooth, metallic surface reflects light, highlighting its well-defined contours and sharp lines. The front of the SUV is characterized by a bold grille and sharp headlights, giving it a dynamic and assertive appearance. As the sequence progresses, the SUV moves steadily forward, its wheels turning smoothly on the road. The side profile reveals tinted windows and a streamlined body, emphasizing its spacious interior and robust build. The rear of the SUV is equipped with stylish taillights and a subtle spoiler, adding to its sporty aesthetic. Throughout the sequence, the SUV maintains a consistent speed, suggesting a confident and controlled drive, seamlessly integrating into the flow of traffic.

## OpenAI-compatible API

* [`dam_server.py`](dam_server.py) - Core server implementation providing an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint for the Describe Anything Model (DAM), handling both image and video inputs with streaming support. We use the alpha channel for image/video mask for the region of interest.

python dam_server.py --model-path nvidia/DAM-3B --conv-mode v1 --prompt-mode focal_prompt --temperature 0.2 --top_p 0.9 --num_beams 1 --max_new_tokens 512 --workers 1

# Image-video joint DAM
python dam_server.py --model-path nvidia/DAM-3B-Video --conv-mode v1 --prompt-mode focal_prompt --temperature 0.2 --top_p 0.9 --num_beams 1 --max_new_tokens 512 --workers 1 --image_video_joint_checkpoint
